    - Write your System Prompt (Text) between the " of system_prompt (a prompt for personalizing the AI that will work always in your user prompt)
      
    - Set the max_nex_tokens (the maximum number of tokens that the model will generate in response to your input, in this case Phi 2 AI is limited to a max of 2048 tokens you can put, remember tokens are the basic units of text or code processed in the AI)
      
    - Set the repition_penalty (Penalize repeated tokens, so make the AI repeat less of itself)
